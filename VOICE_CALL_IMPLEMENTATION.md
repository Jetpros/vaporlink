# Voice/Video Call Feature Implementation

## 🎯 Progress Overview

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)
All backend infrastructure and state management is in place.

#### 1. Data Models (`lib/memory-store.ts`)
- ✅ **Call Entity**: Tracks active calls with status, initiator, timestamps
- ✅ **CallParticipant Entity**: Tracks individual participant status in calls
- ✅ **CRUD Operations**: Full create, read, update, delete for calls
- ✅ **Helper Methods**: Get active call by room, get participants by call

#### 2. Socket.IO Events (`server/socket-server.ts`)
- ✅ **call:start** - Initiate a new call
- ✅ **call:accept** - Accept incoming call
- ✅ **call:decline** - Decline incoming call
- ✅ **call:join** - Join ongoing call (late joiners)
- ✅ **call:leave** - Leave active call
- ✅ **call:toggle-audio** - Mute/unmute microphone
- ✅ **call:toggle-video** - Enable/disable camera
- ✅ **call:incoming** - Broadcast to participants
- ✅ **call:participant-joined** - Notify when someone joins
- ✅ **call:participant-left** - Notify when someone leaves
- ✅ **call:participant-updated** - Notify audio/video changes
- ✅ **call:ended** - Notify when call ends

#### 3. React Hook (`hooks/use-call.ts`)
- ✅ **State Management**: Tracks call status, participants, initiator
- ✅ **startCall()**: Start a new call
- ✅ **acceptCall()**: Accept incoming call
- ✅ **declineCall()**: Decline incoming call
- ✅ **joinCall()**: Join ongoing call
- ✅ **leaveCall()**: Leave active call
- ✅ **toggleAudio()**: Control microphone
- ✅ **toggleVideo()**: Control camera
- ✅ **Event Listeners**: Auto-sync with Socket.IO events

---

### ✅ Phase 2: UI Components (COMPLETED)
All user interface components are built and ready.

#### 1. CallButton (`components/chat/CallButton.tsx`)
- ✅ Phone icon button in chat header
- ✅ Tooltip showing "Start voice/video call"
- ✅ Visual indicator when call is active (green dot)
- ✅ Disabled state when call already in progress

#### 2. IncomingCallModal (`components/chat/IncomingCallModal.tsx`)
- ✅ Full-screen modal with caller info
- ✅ Caller avatar with pulsing animation
- ✅ Accept (green) and Decline (red) buttons
- ✅ Auto-decline after 30 seconds
- ✅ Countdown timer display
- ✅ Visual indicators (bouncing dots)
- ✅ Placeholder for ringing sound

#### 3. CallIndicator (`components/chat/CallIndicator.tsx`)
- ✅ Persistent banner at top of screen
- ✅ Shows participant count
- ✅ Shows call duration (live timer)
- ✅ Pulsing phone icon animation
- ✅ "Join Call" button (for declined/late users)
- ✅ Different text for users in call vs not in call
- ✅ Gradient purple/pink design

#### 4. CallInterface (`components/chat/CallInterface.tsx`)
- ✅ Full-screen call view
- ✅ Video grid layout (responsive)
- ✅ Participant tiles with avatars
- ✅ Control bar with buttons:
  - Mute/Unmute microphone
  - Enable/Disable video
  - Screen share (placeholder)
  - Leave call (red button)
- ✅ Visual indicators for muted/video off
- ✅ "You" label for current user
- ✅ Participant count display
- ✅ Speaking indicator (green dot)

## ✅ Current Status: Phase 2 Complete - Integration Done!

### What Was Integrated:
1. ✅ **Imported all call components** into ChatRoom.tsx
2. ✅ **Added useCall hook** with proper state management
3. ✅ **Wired up event handlers** (start, accept, decline, join, leave)
4. ✅ **Replaced Phone button** with CallButton in header
5. ✅ **Added IncomingCallModal** for incoming call notifications
6. ✅ **Added CallIndicator** banner for active calls
7. ✅ **Added CallInterface** full-screen view when in call

### Integration Details:
- **CallButton**: Shows in header, disabled when socket not connected
- **IncomingCallModal**: Appears when receiving call, auto-dismiss after 30s
- **CallIndicator**: Persistent banner at top showing call status
- **CallInterface**: Full-screen overlay when user is actively in call
- **Socket Integration**: Uses existing socket from useSocket hook
- **State Management**: All call state managed by useCall hook

## 📋 Remaining Work

### Phase 3: WebRTC Integration (PENDING)
- [ ] Choose WebRTC provider (Daily.co recommended)
- [ ] Install dependencies (`@daily-co/daily-js`)
- [ ] Create Daily.co account and get API key
- [ ] Add Daily.co room creation API
- [ ] Integrate Daily.co video/audio streams
- [ ] Replace placeholder video tiles with real streams
- [ ] Handle permissions (mic/camera)
- [ ] Add error handling for WebRTC

### Phase 4: Polish & Edge Cases (PENDING)
- [ ] Add ringing sound effect
- [ ] Add join/leave sound effects
- [ ] Handle network disconnections
- [ ] Handle permission denials
- [ ] Add screen sharing functionality
- [ ] Add call recording (optional)
- [ ] Mobile optimization
- [ ] Browser compatibility checks
- [ ] Add call quality indicators
- [ ] Handle room expiry during call

## 🎨 User Flow (Designed)

### Starting a Call:
1. User clicks phone icon in chat header
2. Socket.IO creates call in memory
3. All online participants receive `call:incoming` event
4. IncomingCallModal appears for recipients
5. CallIndicator shows for initiator
6. Initiator sees CallInterface immediately

### Receiving a Call:
1. IncomingCallModal pops up with caller info
2. Ringing sound plays (30s timeout)
3. User clicks Accept → joins call
4. User clicks Decline → modal closes, CallIndicator appears
5. Auto-decline after 30s → same as manual decline

### During Call:
1. CallInterface shows all participants
2. Video tiles in grid layout
3. Controls at bottom (mute, video, leave)
4. Real-time updates when participants join/leave
5. Visual indicators for muted/video off

### Joining Mid-Call:
1. User sees CallIndicator banner
2. Clicks "Join Call" button
3. Permissions requested
4. Joins CallInterface
5. Other participants notified

### Leaving Call:
1. User clicks red phone button
2. Removed from call
3. Returns to chat view
4. CallIndicator still visible (can rejoin)
5. When last person leaves → call ends for everyone

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Data Flow:
```
User Action → ChatRoom Component → useCall Hook → Socket.IO → Server
                                                        ↓
Server → Memory Store (update call state) → Broadcast to room
                                                        ↓
All Clients ← Socket.IO ← useCall Hook ← UI Updates
```

### State Management:
```typescript
CallState {
  callId: string | null
  status: 'idle' | 'ringing' | 'joining' | 'active' | 'ended'
  initiator: CallParticipant | null
  participants: CallParticipant[]
  roomUrl?: string  // Daily.co URL (Phase 3)
}
```

### Socket.IO Room Pattern:
- Chat room: `room:${roomId}`
- All call events broadcast to same room
- Participants auto-join on socket connection

## 🚀 Ready for Integration

All foundation and UI components are complete. The next step is to integrate everything into the ChatRoom component and test the full flow. After that, we'll add WebRTC for actual video/audio streaming.

**Estimated Time Remaining:**
- Phase 2 Integration: 30 minutes
- Phase 3 WebRTC: 2-3 hours
- Phase 4 Polish: 1-2 hours

**Total: ~4-6 hours to complete feature**
