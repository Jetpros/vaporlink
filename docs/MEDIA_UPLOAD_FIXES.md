# Media Upload & Voice Recording Fixes

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Voice Recording Button Not Working** 🎤
**Problem:** Clicking the microphone button did nothing

**Root Cause:**
- No permission request for microphone access
- No error handling for permission denials
- Silent failures when microphone not available

**Solution:**
- Added explicit microphone permission request
- Comprehensive error handling for all permission scenarios
- User-friendly toast notifications for errors
- Console logging for debugging

---

### 2. **Media vs File Upload Confusion** 📎
**Problem:** All uploads treated the same (showed file modal)

**User's Request:**
- **Photo/Video/Audio** from media selector → Send inline (visible in chat)
- **File** with any content → Send as attachment (download link)

**Solution:**
- Photo/Video/Audio selections now send **directly** as inline media
- File selection shows modal (even for images/videos/audio)
- Clear UI labels showing "Send inline" vs "Send as attachment"

---

## ✨ What Changed

### Voice Recording Button

**Before:**
```typescript
onClick={() => setIsRecordingVoice(true)}
// No permission check, fails silently
```

**After:**
```typescript
onClick={async () => {
  // 1. Check browser support
  if (!navigator.mediaDevices?.getUserMedia) {
    toast({ title: "Not Supported" });
    return;
  }
  
  // 2. Request permission
  await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true });
  
  // 3. Start recording
  setIsRecordingVoice(true);
  
  // 4. Handle errors with helpful messages
  catch (error) {
    if (error.name === "NotAllowedError") {
      toast({ title: "Permission Denied" });
    } else if (error.name === "NotFoundError") {
      toast({ title: "No Microphone" });
    }
  }
}
```

### Media Upload Flow

**Before:**
```
User selects Photo → File modal → User adds caption → Send
User selects File → File modal → User adds caption → Send
```

**After:**
```
User selects Photo → Sends IMMEDIATELY as inline image ✅
User selects Video → Sends IMMEDIATELY as inline video ✅
User selects Audio → Sends IMMEDIATELY as inline audio ✅
User selects File → File modal → Send as attachment 📎
```

## 📋 Updated UI

### Media Selector Dropdown

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ 📷 Photo                    │
│    Send inline              │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ 🎥 Video                    │
│    Send inline              │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ 🎵 Audio                    │
│    Send inline              │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ 📄 File                     │
│    Send as attachment       │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Clear Distinction:
- **Photo/Video/Audio** = Viewable/playable in chat
- **File** = Download link with file icon
