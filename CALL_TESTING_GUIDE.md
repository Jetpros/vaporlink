## 🔍 What to Check

### Visual Elements:
- ✅ CallButton shows green dot when call active
- ✅ IncomingCallModal has pulsing avatar animation
- ✅ CallIndicator has gradient purple/pink background
- ✅ CallInterface shows all participants in grid
- ✅ Mute/video indicators appear correctly
- ✅ Speaking indicator (green dot) shows when unmuted

### Console Logs:
Look for these in browser console:
```
📞 Call start requested by [participantId]
📞 Call created: [callId]
📞 Incoming call from: [displayName]
📞 Call accepted by [participantId]
📞 Participant joined call: [displayName]
📞 Call leave by [participantId]
📞 Call ended - all participants left
```

### Socket.IO Events:
Check Network tab → WS (WebSocket):
- `call:start` → Creates call
- `call:incoming` → Broadcasts to participants
- `call:accept` → User joins
- `call:join` → Late joiner
- `call:leave` → User leaves
- `call:ended` → Call terminates

## 🐛 Known Limitations (Current Phase)

### ⚠️ No Actual Video/Audio Yet
- **Current**: Placeholder avatars shown
- **Phase 3**: Will add WebRTC for real streams

### ⚠️ No Ringing Sound
- **Current**: Silent notification
- **Phase 4**: Will add audio files

### ⚠️ No Screen Sharing
- **Current**: Button disabled
- **Phase 4**: Will implement

### ⚠️ No Call Recording
- **Future**: Optional feature

---

## ✅ What Should Work Now

### Backend:
- ✅ Call creation in memory store
- ✅ Socket.IO event broadcasting
- ✅ Participant tracking
- ✅ Call state management
- ✅ Auto-end when last person leaves

### Frontend:
- ✅ Start call button
- ✅ Incoming call modal
- ✅ Accept/decline functionality
- ✅ Join call anytime
- ✅ Leave call
- ✅ Mute/unmute (state only)
- ✅ Video toggle (state only)
- ✅ Participant list
- ✅ Call duration timer
- ✅ Visual indicators

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: CallButton is disabled
**Solution**: Check Socket.IO connection
- Look for green "LIVE" badge in header
- Check console for connection errors
- Restart dev server if needed

### Issue: IncomingCallModal doesn't appear
**Solution**: Check browser console
- Look for "📞 Incoming call from" log
- Verify Socket.IO events in Network tab
- Ensure both users are in same room

### Issue: Can't join call
**Solution**: Check call state
- Verify callId exists in state
- Check for error toasts
- Look for Socket.IO errors

### Issue: Participants not updating
**Solution**: Check Socket.IO broadcasts
- Verify "call:participant-joined" events
- Check useCall hook listeners
- Restart both browser windows
